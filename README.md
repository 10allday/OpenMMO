# OpenMMO
OpenMMO - Groundwork

OpenMMO is designed to serve as the cornerstone 
to the foundation upon which a massive multiplayer 
game can be developed.

Core System Addons
-User Authentication
-Account Data Management
-Multi-Server Scene and Zone Management

Game System Addons
-a Server Authoritative Player Movement System
-a World Interaction System
-a basic Chat System
-a very basic example game to demonstrate the usage of these systems.


WHAT IS OPENMMO? 
OpenMMO is NOT a game kit...it is a framework. 
The main goal of OpenMMO is modularity. Our
endgame plan is to create a base foundation 
upon which a game of any genre can be created.
Therefore, one should not expect RPG or other 
genre-specific features etc in the OpenMMO core.
Instead, OpenMMO has been built from the ground 
up to be as modular as possible with a pluggable 
architecture that supports 3rd party addon development
from the gate.
